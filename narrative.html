                    <h1>What is Animal Crossing?</h1>
                    <p>Animal Crossing: New Horizons (ACNH) was released on March 20, 2020, and was the fifth main entry in the Animal Crossing series.</p>
                    <p>The main story of the game begins with landing on a private, deserted island that you, the player, purchased a getaway trip to.</p>
                    <p> Upon landing, the game randomly assigns the island it's airport color, native fruit type, and starting villagers </p>
                    <p>As the game progresses, you meet new villagers and invite them to live on your island, collect insects, fish, and fossils for the museum exhibits, and upgrade your home.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class = "row">
                <div class = "col-6">
                    <img src = "images/island1.png" alt = "Island Flyover Image" class = "img-fluid">
                    <p> This island would not be possible with the base designs; the circular ground designs don't exist as a premade option.</p>
                </div>
                <div class = "col-6">
                    <p>Part of the appeal of ACNH is the various decoration options for making an island customized to every player's preferred aesthetic.</p>
                    <p>Players often decorate the front of their island the most, because this area is shown when others join their island for co-op play.</p>
                    <p>Co-op also allows for more diverse decoration options, with players being able to share designs for flags, clothing, and paths.</p>
                    <p>This has led to far more creative designs than the base options allow, leading to some beautiful island designs.</p>
                    <p>This can lead to some players getting stuck in a cycle of resetting the island generation to get the perfect formula for their decorative plan.</p>

                    <h1>So, Why This Topic?</h1>
                    <p>I chose to focus my research on player's favorite personality type and favorite villagers, and also the the randomness of the game's starting random factors.</p>
                    <p>I chose this topic because I thought it would be interesting to see if a person's favorite personality type seemed to match their favorite villager, and I chose the second topic because I was interested in finding out how random the beginning factors were.</p>
                    <p>The questions I sought to answer were if someone's favorite villager would match their favorite personality type, and what the distribution of starting factors would be after I reset the game one hundred times.</p>
                    <p>I used a Google Survey and posted it to two subreddits, r/AnimalCrossing and r/ACNH, and asked for voluntary responses, and received 96 responses.</p>
