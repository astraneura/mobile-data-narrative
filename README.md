# mobile-data-narrative

This was a project for a Boise State University GIMM class. 

Survey data was collected from online users and I compiled an HTML website to display narratives drawn from that data. 
The data was displayed using D3.js visualizations and the website was built to be responsive with Bootstrap and React.js
